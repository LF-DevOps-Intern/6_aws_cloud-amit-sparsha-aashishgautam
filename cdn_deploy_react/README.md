Deploying React App using S3 and CDN:

Link to aws : http://intern-manip.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Link to cloud front : https://d2s7zjhz77z87g.cloudfront.net/

Configure the CDN to use S3 intern-manip bucket as origin where I deployed my react application and enable the static file hosting in S3 bucket.
